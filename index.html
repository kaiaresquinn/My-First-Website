                    <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
                    <p class="accent">Boulding is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.</p> 
                    <p>Unlike <a href="#">traditional climbing</a> bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.</p>

Bouldering strips climbing down to its purest form, making it both <STRONG>accessible to beginners and endlessly challenging for experts.</STRONG></p>
